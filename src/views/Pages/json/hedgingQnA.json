                "If you have a foreign currency asset, its value in your functional currency changes as the exchange rates move. However, the value of the asset may also be subject to change due to a variety of factors other than exchange rate movements. Once you have determined the foreign currency value of the asset you would like to hedge, you would need to assess for how long you would like to hedge this foreign currency asset. This would depend on the expected time duration when you want to sell this asset. Once you have an estimate of both the amount of foreign currency value of asset and tenor you want to hedge, you can use the Forward contract to hedge this FX exposure. Under the Forward contract hedge, you can sell the expected realised value of foreign currency from the asset sale (or a part of this), in exchange for your functional currency for a future date when you expect to sell the asset, in order to lock-in the exchange rate.",

This could result into cashflow for you, or may require availability of funding in case you are liable to pay. Simultaneously, you can enter into another forward contract (at a new prevailing exchange rate) for a new maturity date when you expect the asset sale now to happen.",

A Forward contract may not be a suitable instrument for hedging such uncertain value of foreign currency receipt through an asset sale at a future date. As an alternative, you may only hedge a part of expected future foreign currency sale value if the amount of foreign currency realisable through the asset sale is uncertain."

                "A foreign currency loan for longer than 1-year tenor which involves both interest and principal payment can be best hedged using a Cross currency swap. However, a Forward contract (or a series of Forward contracts can also be used to hedge the corresponding expected foreign currency payments under the loan for both interest and principal payments at a future date.",
                "For example, if you have a EUR loan of 10 million for 1 year maturity, in which you are expected to make an interest payment of EUR 1.25 million every six month, and if your functional currency is GBP, you can do two Forward contracts to hedge the FX risk on your EUR loan; one where you buy EUR 1.25 million for 6 months to cover interest rate payments, and the other where you would buy EUR 11.25 million for 12 months for interest and principal payment in exchange for payment of known GBP amounts for each of these two Forward contracts.",
                "The GBPEUR exchange rate for each of these contract (one for 6 months, and the other for 12 month), will be different but known at the time of dealing in each of these two Forward contracts. In the above example, interest payments were known after six month and 12 months. When the loan is linked to a floating interest rates, such as Euribor, or Libor, interest payments may not be known in advance, and this may present difficulty in determining the value of currency purchase that needs to be made to hedge the FX risk. One can deal with this by estimating the interest payment amount and hedging a lower amount to be conservative (with risk that some amount may remain unhedged). Alternatively, only the principal payment (in above case EUR 10 million) which is the majority of the risk can be hedged. However, this will leave interest payments in EUR unhedged. To hedge floating rate foreign currency loans of 1 year and longer, you can also explore using cross currency swaps, which may offer a more perfect hedge."

                "However, all M&A transactions go through various levels of uncertainty before they become certain and amounts and timings are known. Until then, hedging using Forward contracts presents a challenge of hedge rebalancing, rolling over, or restructuring with related potential adverse cost consequences. If this be the case, you could also explore FX options contracts to hedge the risk of currency fluctuations. However, depending on the level of protection requirement, FX Options can be expensive, and may require up-front payment (or payment over agreed time period if agreed with your hedge provider).",

These contingent hedges can be suitable in certain specific situations, and require very careful assessment of suitability and appropriateness for your own specific situation. To evaluate this, you may benefit from your internal resources, and external advisors including legal advisors."

Both the unwinding of the existing Forward hedge, and entering into a new Forward hedge for the new maturity can be done at the same time to avoid any loss or gain due to FX spot price movement. On doing the new Forward contract for additional period, you may have to pay the cost (or you may benefit) from forward points for the additional period. In summary, the adjustment required due to changes in expected date of receipt or payment on original Forward contract may result in additional costs for you and the requirement of funds at the time of settlement of original Forward contract.",

However, this would require waiting for the functional currency when you actually may need these funds right now for some expenses in your functional currency.  Also, the deposit of your foreign currency in the meantime may not give you any interest rate depending upon the bank account and the currency in which the money is deposited. Therefore, this may not be a preferable alternative for you. Alternatively, you can sell this foreign currency on spot market to realise the functional currency, and at the same time unwind or cancel the existing Forward contract. The unwinding or cancelling the Forward contract would result into a payment to you or a payment from you depending on the exchange rate market at the time. However, if you pay an amount on the cancellation of Forward hedge, you would have made gains in your spot conversion deal, and if you receive payments on the cancellation of Forward hedge, you would have had higher costs on spot conversion deal. The combination of this, i.e., spot deal and simultaneous cancellation of Forward contract would provide you hedging from FX risks.",

The combination of this, i.e., spot deal and simultaneous cancellation of Forward contract would provide you hedging from FX risks."
