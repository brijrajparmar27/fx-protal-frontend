This allows you to fix exchange rates for the purchase of currency at a future date, or over a range of dates, up to 12 months into the future. A margin deposit may be required, depending on many factors including credit risk of your company, currency pair involved, maturity of contract, and market volatility."]

The so-called Forward curve (which is expectation of a future Forward rate for different tenors) can be upward or downward sloping. For example, there are cases where the 12-month forward rate would be better than the current spot rate (this would mean benefit) and there are cases where the 12-month forward rate would be worse (this would mean cost)."]

The disadvantage of FX Forward is potential opportunity cost in case of a favourable movement in the currency pair in the future."]
